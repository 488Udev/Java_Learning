Intro: Java is a programming language that is platform independent and can be written once and run anywhere. 
Know the basics,learn about JVM, JRE,JDK and how Java works in general and also it's constantly upgrading so it is recommended to work with higher version of Java.

This is a basic repo to practice Java and learn,feel free to clone and see the basics

Feel free to make changes and practice along

1) Basics.Variables
Basics.Variables store data values in Java. They have types like int, double, String, and boolean.A variable must be declared before use: int age = 25;.
2) Operators
Operators perform operations on variables and values in Java. They include arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), comparison (==, !=, >, <), and logical (&&, ||, !).
3) Basics.DataTypes
Data types define what kind of data a variable can store. Primitive types: int (numbers), double (decimals), char (letters), boolean (true/false).
Non-primitive types: String (text), arrays, and objects.
4) Stack and Heap
Java memory is divided into Stack and Heap. Stack stores method calls and local variables, and it is fast. Heap stores objects and is used for dynamic memory allocation.
Garbage Collector clears unused objects from the heap.
5) Methods
Methods are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help reuse code and keep programs organized. public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }.
Methods can take input (parameters) and return a result.
6) Class - A class is a blueprint for creating objects in Java. It defines variables (fields) and methods (functions).
7) Object - An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the new keyword.
8) Method Overloading
Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. It allows methods to perform similar tasks with different inputs.
9) Constructor
A constructor is a special method used to create objects. It has the same name as the class and no return type.
10) Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to reuse another class's properties and methods. The extends keyword is used for inheritance.
11) Polymorphism - Polymorphism allows one method to behave differently based on the object. It is of two types: Method Overloading (Compile-time) and Method Overriding
12) Encapsulation
Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods in a class.It helps protect data using private access modifiers and getter/setter methods.
13) Abstraction 
Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features. It is achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.
14) Interface 
An interface is like a blueprint with only method declarations (no body). A class implements an interface using the implements keyword.
15) Exception Handling
    Exception handling deals with runtime errors to prevent program crashes. It uses try, catch, finally, and throw.
16) Final Keyword
    The final keyword is used to prevent modification. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.
17) Static Keyword
    The static keyword is used for class-level variables and methods. Static members belong to the class, not to individual objects.
18) Multithreading
    Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
    Threads can be created using Thread class or Runnable interface.
19) Collections Framework
    Java Collections provide dynamic data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, and LinkedList.
20) Lambda Expressions (Java 8)
    Lambdas provide a shorter way to write functions in Java.
    They are used mainly with functional interfaces.
21) Streams (Java 8)
    Streams process collections efficiently using functional programming.
